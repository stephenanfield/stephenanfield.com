			 <p>Martine Abel-Williamson, President, <a href="https://worldblindunion.org/">World Blind Union</a> <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2023/august/lego-braille-bricks-play-with-braille-?locale=en-us">commented for LEGO®</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For blind and partially sighted children, and adults for that matter, it makes all the difference if they can share their journey of learning braille with the people they love the most. For the blind community, braille is not just literacy, it’s our entry to independence and inclusion into this world, and to have LEGO Braille Bricks made available for the wider public is a massive step forward to ensuring more children will want to learn braille in the first place.</p>

<p>Accessibility in learning and play. 🧱</p>

<p>Prioritizing care means respecting the care seeker’s dignity, agency, and autonomy. Care-seeker choice gives patients some control over their healthcare journey, and it can improve patient access and satisfaction, particularly for marginalized people.</p>
